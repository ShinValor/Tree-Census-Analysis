# Overview
In 2016, New York City made public the results of TreesCount, the 2015 Street Tree Census, conducted by volunteers and staff organized by the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation as well as partner organizations. The data includes information about more than 680,000 trees on the streets of New York City. This is a large dataset, with over 683,000 lines of text totaling more than 193 MB of data. Although it will fit into computer's memory, it will make many computers behave sluggishly, depending on what you do with the data. The project objective is to process the datasets in a piecewise way rather than by reading the entire data set into a single contiguous data structure such as a vector or an array.
